# About this LOCAL folder

This folder contains all config files that are specifically run in actual deployed (local/live) systems.
It must be maintained in the deployed system.

This overrides `global` and `development` configs.

Copy the `*.php.dist` files in this folder and rename their copies to `*.php.` Adjust them to your needs.
